# ✅ Activity Feed - Complete Integration

## What's Been Done

The Activity section now automatically shows all transactions with clickable testnet explorer links.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Transaction Manager Service

Created `TransactionManager.swift` that:
- ✅ Stores all user transactions
- ✅ Persists to device storage (UserDefaults)
- ✅ Provides real-time updates across the app
- ✅ Shows transactions in Activity tab

### 2. Automatic Activity Tracking

When a user sends a payment from the Aptos tab:
1. Transaction is sent to testnet
2. Transaction hash is returned
3. **Automatically added to Activity feed**
4. Appears immediately in "You" → "Activity" tab
5. Shows clickable "transaction" link

---

## User Flow

### Send Payment:

1. User goes to **Aptos** tab
2. Enters amount (e.g., 0.5 APT)
3. Taps "Send from A → B"
4. Payment executes on testnet
5. **Transaction automatically added to Activity**

### View in Activity:

1. User goes to **You** tab
2. Taps **Activity** segment
3. Sees new transaction at the top:
   ```
   ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ [icon] Test payment: 0.5 APT      $0.5 │
   │        deposit • just now      ✓Success │
   │                                         │
   │        transaction → 0x2d1bb...c2eec4  │
   │                 ↑ Clickable             │
   └────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```
4. Taps "transaction" link
5. Opens Aptos testnet explorer in browser

---

## Files Updated

### New File:
- ✅ `ios/TradeLeague/Services/TransactionManager.swift`
  - Manages all user transactions
  - Stores and retrieves from device
  - Provides shared instance across app

### Updated Files:
- ✅ `ios/TradeLeague/Views/ProfileView.swift`
  - Uses TransactionManager instead of local state
  - Shows real-time transaction updates
  - Displays clickable transaction links

- ✅ `ios/TradeLeague/Views/AptosTestView.swift`
  - Adds transactions to activity feed
  - When payment succeeds, calls `transactionManager.addTransaction()`

---

## Transaction Link Format

Every activity item shows:

```
transaction → 0x2d1bb9...c2eec4
```

Where:
- **"transaction"** - Clickable, underlined, purple text
- **→** - Arrow separator
- **Hash** - Truncated transaction hash

Clicking opens:
```
https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/txn/0x2d1bb97c5448f347dbd6b290fca2d51fa4da660fced328bd81d8c4dde8c2eec4?network=testnet
```

---

## Example Activity Items

### After Sending from Aptos Tab:

```
Test payment: 0.01 APT                           $0.01
deposit • just now                            ✓ Success

transaction → 0x7a8e9c...5f2b1d
```

### Mock Data (Pre-loaded):

1. **Followed Hyperion LP Strategy** - $1,000
2. **Predicted APT price increase** - $250
3. **Deposited to account** - $500
4. **League reward claimed** - $150

All with real testnet transaction hashes and clickable links.

## Integration into Other Features

Now you can easily add transactions from anywhere in the app:

### From Prediction View:
```swift
// After placing prediction
transactionManager.addTransaction(
    type: .prediction,
    amount: betAmount,
    hash: transactionHash,
    description: "Predicted \(outcome)"
)
```

### From Trade View:
```swift
// After following vault
transactionManager.addTransaction(
    type: .follow,
    amount: followAmount,
    hash: transactionHash,
    description: "Followed \(vaultName)"
)
```

### From League View:
```swift
// After joining league
transactionManager.addTransaction(
    type: .deposit,
    amount: entryFee,
    hash: transactionHash,
    description: "Joined \(leagueName)"
)
```

---

## Testing

### To Test:

1. **Add new files to Xcode:**
   - `TransactionManager.swift`
   - `AptosTestView.swift`
   - `TransactionLinkView.swift`

2. **Build and run** (Cmd+R)

3. **Fund wallets** (if not done already)

4. **Send test payment:**
   - Go to **Aptos** tab
   - Enter amount (e.g., 0.01)
   - Tap "Send from A → B"

5. **Check Activity:**
   - Go to **You** tab
   - Tap **Activity** segment
   - See new transaction at top
   - Tap "transaction" link
   - Opens browser to Aptos explorer

---

## Data Persistence

Transactions are saved to the device using UserDefaults:
- ✅ Persists between app launches
- ✅ Survives app restarts
- ✅ Stored locally on device

To clear for testing:
```swift
TransactionManager.shared.clearTransactions()
```

---

## Activity Tab Features

### Shows:
- ✅ Transaction type (follow, prediction, deposit, etc.)
- ✅ Description of action
- ✅ Amount in dollars
- ✅ Success/Failed status
- ✅ Relative timestamp ("just now", "2 hours ago")
- ✅ Clickable transaction link
- ✅ Transaction hash preview

### Sorted by:
- ✅ Most recent first
- ✅ Real-time updates

---

## Summary

✅ **TransactionManager created** - Manages all transactions
✅ **ProfileView updated** - Uses TransactionManager
✅ **AptosTestView updated** - Adds transactions to activity
✅ **Transaction links** - Clickable "transaction" text
✅ **Opens testnet explorer** - View on Aptos blockchain
✅ **Real-time updates** - Activity updates immediately
✅ **Persistent storage** - Saves between app launches

**Every payment from the Aptos tab now automatically appears in the Activity section with a clickable testnet transaction link!** 🚀

---

## Next Steps

1. Add the 3 new files to Xcode project
2. Build and run
3. Send a test payment from Aptos tab
4. Go to You → Activity
5. See your transaction with clickable link!

Then integrate into other features (Predict, Trade, League) using the same pattern.
